                <p>"In the heart of winter, Yuki was born,  
                A child of the cold, a soul forlorn.  
                With no one to hold, no hand to find,  
                He wandered alone, a quiet mind.  
                His heart, a fragile glass, so clear,  
                Yet no one saw, no one drew near.  
                Transparent, empty, his pain concealed,  
                A silent cry that none would heal.  
                Every word he spoke felt distant, lost,  
                For trust was shattered at great cost.  
                No one knew the tears he wept,  
                A quiet sorrow that never slept.  
                He yearned for warmth, a simple touch,  
                A hand to grasp, a love to clutch.  
                But the world was silent, cold as stone,  
                Leaving Yuki to face it alone.  
                'All I wanted was to be seen,'  
                His heartache echoed, raw, unseen.  
                He searched for comfort, for a friend,  
                But each attempt would break again.  
                'Someone, please, can you hear my plea?  
                I long for love, to just be free.  
                Help me heal, for I can't bear  
                This endless emptiness in the air.'  
                But who will hear him in the night?  
                Who will break through his frozen fight?  
                Yuki's heart, a fragile plea,  
                Waiting for someone to set him free."</p>
